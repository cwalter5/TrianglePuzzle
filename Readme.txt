Notes
====================================================================================================
* I ran into a small problem with Java 1.7 and the default files project files created by Eclipse.
    If you run into it you should be able to resolve it by explicitly setting your JDK.
* Everything related to the project was built using Eclipse. Thus you should be able to rebuild
    by typing gradle eclipse.
* A runnable command line app can be generated by typing gradle installApp then look in 
    build\Install\TrianglePuzzle\bin and run TrianglePuzzle <path of content file>
* The command line app was already generated and exists as part of the previous file location.

As noted in the master class:
Finds the maximum value for a path of nodes in a file provided by command line argument.
This solution is optimized for memory usage and speed. Please note however, that due to these
optimizations no other information regarding the file is available including the path that was
taken. This allows us to run with very little memory used and would allow this 
solution to scale out to extremely large file sizes.
 
Also please note that this solution is incompatible with unbalanced trees as the documentation
provided gave no reason to believe one would be analyzed.
